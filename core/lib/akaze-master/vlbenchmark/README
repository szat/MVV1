The code in this folder is for A-KAZE evaluation in the VLBenchmarks.
I assume you have Matlab installed in your computer. The next steps are:

1. Download VLBenchmarks in your computer:
http://www.vlfeat.org/benchmarks/

2. Compile akaze_features and move the executable file to: 
/vlfeat-vlbenchmarks/data/software/akaze/

3. Copy the file AKAZE.m to:
/vlfeat-vlbenchmarks/+localFeatures/

4. Copy the file RepeatabilityBenchmarkMod.m to:
/vlfeat-vlbenchmarks/+benchmarks/

RepeatabilityBenchmarkMod contains some modifications with respect to the original 
RepeatabilityBenchmark, such as checking pixel location error.

5. Copy the script test_detector_bikes_akaze.m to:
/vlfeat-vlbenchmarks/

Run the script to evaluate A-KAZE in the bikes dataset. You can change the script for 
evaluation in other datasets.
