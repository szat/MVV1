Style conventions
-----------------

Variable, function, class names, commit comments and branch names should be descriptive, but as short as possible.

For .cpp code:

Variable names (camelCase):
    -exampleVariable
Function and class names (CapitalCase):
    -ExampleFunction
    -ExampleClass
Comments:
    -Keep the amount of comments to a minimum.
    -Comments should be short but descriptive.
    -Comments like "adding loop to iterate here" are worse than useless
    -Outdated comments are worse than useless. Comments should be updated with the code, or else deleted.
    
For all files:
    -File names should use all lowercase and underscores (eg. example_file.cpp
    
For source control:
    -Commits such as "feature added", or "bug fixed" are again, worse than useless
    -Keep commit names under 20 characters
