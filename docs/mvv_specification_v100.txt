MVV File Format Specification
-----------------------------
Version: v1.00
Date: 2017-05-09


1. Introduction



File specification for .mvv files


The beginning of the file consists of a fixed-width header which specifies some information about the file.
The numbers specify the array position (not the byte number).

The mvv files contain N frames.

This structure will later be changed from width/height to rows/columns

HEADER (64 BYTES)
----------------------
0: (char[4]) Filespec version number
(first two allocated for major version, second two for minor verson, starting at 01.00)
1: (int) total number of frames in this file
2: (int) imageA width
3: (int) imageA height
4: (int) imageB width
5: (int) imageB height
6-15: reserved (0x00000000 for now)

FRAMESPEC: (repeating variable length blocks)
Frame header (N bytes)
0: (int) frame number
1: (int) number triangles

Affine component
N*6 floats, forward affine parameters
N*6 floats, reverse affine parameters

RBGT 4 channel block:

RGB blocks are 
char[][]
char[][]
char[][]
(separate)

T block:
short[][] (2 bytes)



2. Validation and Corruption

How to check that an .mvv file is valid?
-Byte lengths, ensuring that everything is in it's place, scanning through

MVV Validator command line application


4. Compression Scheme

In its current form, the .mvv file format is uncompressed. Further iterations
will require some combination of temporal and spatial compression.

11.  Interoperability Considerations

11.1. The size of char in C++ is invariant, however the inclusion of
   short and float values in the filespec results in OS-specific 
   implementation problems.
   
   Presently, the files are only guaranteed to work in a Windows 10 x64
   architecture.

   The C++ language provides facilities for OS-independent ways to ensure
   uniform type lengths, but at this stage it is not implemented.
